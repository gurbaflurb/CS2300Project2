# Program2 for CS 2300
This program takes a text value with seven values and attempts to use the values given to draw a graph in the terminal. This is based on the scheme: llx lly d p1 p2 v1 v2. Where llx and lly are the lower left x and y coordinates, d is the size of the target box, p1 and p2 are a given point, and v1 and v2 are a vector.

## To Build
Use the makefile included to build an executable using the `make` command. This should build an executable "main" which can be run.
